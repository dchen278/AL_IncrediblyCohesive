DISCO:
*In ALtester, by saying ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();, we initialze a list of integers and are able yo use methods in class ArrayList
*Binary search is an algorithm used to find a specific item in a sorted list of items. We do this by effectively splitting the array in half and using what is in the middle to our advantage.
Basically, you repeatedly divide the search interval of your array by half. You should start off by covering the whole array.

QCC:
What is a collection in java? Is it the same as an array/list?
